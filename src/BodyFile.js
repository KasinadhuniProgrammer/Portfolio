            <center><h3>Hello, welcome to my website! I am Satvik Kasinadhuni, currently a <bold>Sophomore at Farmington High School</bold> in Connecticut, and a <bold>Full Stack Developer</bold>!</h3></center>
            <center><h3>My journey with Computer Programming kicked off in 2015, when I was in 5th grade and wanted to create a rock paper scissor game to play with my computer. I realized that I will need to know coding in order to do this, so I decided to start off with Python! I went to my public library and got this amazing book that taught me the core Python language, and I eventually created my rock paper scissor game!</h3></center>
            <center><h3>I immediately fell in love with coding, I decided I want to learn more about computer programming and continue building my skill in this field. I immediately picked up with learning Java, and even though I did not like it as much as Python, I still enjoyed learning it.</h3></center>
            <center><h3>In 2017, when I was in 7th grade, I joined a First Tech Challenge team, where I would code autonomous programs for a robot using Java. Joining a First Tech Challenge team really opened up more doors in my Computer Programming journey. I started to learn more about Java, and programming in general. I also discovered Android Studio and was able to experiement with that. I learned about this thing called GitHub, and how cool and useful it is!</h3></center>
            <center><h3>Later on, I discovered JavaScript and I immediately fell in love with it, that it became my favorite programming language. JavaScript opened up doors to my Full Stack Development career, as I started learning things like React.js and Firebase.</h3></center>
            <center><h3>I decided to focus more on Full Stack Development and currently I am working on projects that involve using React.js and Firebase, in order to strengthen my skills, and build Software that can change the world.</h3></center>
