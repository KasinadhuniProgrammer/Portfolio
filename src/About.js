            <h3 className="about__firstpara">Software is taking over the world, it is like a whole new world itself! Software is making a huge positive impact on humanity, as we can see that in the pandemic we are all facing right now. We are able to use things such as Google Meet and Zoom to continue education safely, communicate with our family and friends, etc. We are able to use things such as Netflix and Amazon Prime in order to watch new movies and tv shows on demand, safely from our homes. Overall, most of the things we are now doing involve some sort of software. This means, most of the things that we do, are all being done due to the work software engineers.</h3>
            <h3 className="about__secondpara">It is clear that Software will continue to be a huge part of our lives, and software can solve the biggest problems in the world, only if we have the right minds in the field.</h3>
            <h3 className="about__thirdpara">Many of us, the future generation, are starting to find a passion in Software Engineering, and are going into the Computer Science field.
